The Lean Product Playbook by Dan Olsen

# Introduction
- The main reason products fail is because they don't meet customer needs in a way that is better than other alternatives.
- The Product-Market Fit Pyramid has 5 sections.  The two at the bottom are part of the Market and the three at the top are part of the Product.  From bottom to top: Target Customer, Underserved Needs, Value Proposition, Feature Set, UX.
- Lean Product Process consists of six steps:
	- Determine your target customers
	- Identify underserved customer needs
	- Define your value proposition
	- Specify your minimum viable product (MVP) feature set
	- Create your MVP prototype
	- Test your MVP with customers
- The book walks you through detailed explanations of UX design and Agile development.  It also provides in-depth coverage of analytics and how to use metrics to optimize your product.

# Part I: Core Concepts
- Chapter 1: Achieving Product-Market Fit with the Lean Product Process
	- Minimizing rework is a key tactic for eliminating waste which is a key concept in Lean manufacturing.
	- You will have some rework with the Lean Product Process because it is an iterative process that requires you to revise your hypotheses, designs, and product as you make progress.
	- The goal of the process is to achieve product-market fit as quickly as possible.
	- Bruce Lee said, "Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own."

- Chapter 2: Problem Space versus Solution Space
	- Outside-in product development is the essense of Lean - and was actually first advocated for years ago by practitioners of user-centered design.
	- The best problem space learning often comes from feedback you receive from customers on the solution space artifacts you have created.
