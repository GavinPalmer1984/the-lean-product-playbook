The Lean Product Playbook by Dan Olsen

# Introduction
- The main reason products fail is because they don't meet customer needs in a way that is better than other alternatives.
- The Product-Market Fit Pyramid has 5 sections.  The two at the bottom are part of the Market and the three at the top are part of the Product.  From bottom to top: Target Customer, Underserved Needs, Value Proposition, Feature Set, UX.
- Lean Product Process consists of six steps:
	- Determine your target customers
	- Identify underserved customer needs
	- Define your value proposition
	- Specify your minimum viable product (MVP) feature set
	- Create your MVP prototype
	- Test your MVP with customers
- The book walks you through detailed explanations of UX design and Agile development.  It also provides in-depth coverage of analytics and how to use metrics to optimize your product.

# Part I: Core Concepts
- Chapter 1: Achieving Product-Market Fit with the Lean Product Process
	- Minimizing rework is a key tactic for eliminating waste which is a key concept in Lean manufacturing.
	- You will have some rework with the Lean Product Process because it is an iterative process that requires you to revise your hypotheses, designs, and product as you make progress.
	- The goal of the process is to achieve product-market fit as quickly as possible.
	- Bruce Lee said, "Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own."

- Chapter 2: Problem Space versus Solution Space
	- Outside-in product development is the essense of Lean - and was actually first advocated for years ago by practitioners of user-centered design.
	- The best problem space learning often comes from feedback you receive from customers on the solution space artifacts you have created.
	- The reality is that customers are much better at giving you feedback in the solution space. Having solution space discussions with customers is much more fruitful than trying to explicitly discuss the problem space with them.

# Part II: The Lean Product Process
- Chapter 3: Determine Your Target Customer (Step 1)
	- Different customers will have different needs - and even those who have the same needs can have distinct views on their relative importance.
	- Once you have a product or a prototype to show customers, then you can gain clarity about the target market you're attracting.
	- Dividing a broad market into specific subsets based on attributes is called market segmentation.
	- Needs-based segmentation seems very important but may be used to do other kinds of segmentation for ad campaigns.
	- Define your target buyer in addition to the target customer when warranted.
	- We need personas for user-centered design: which is a precise definition of our user and what he wants to accomplish.  Remember that personas are no substitute for talking to customers on an ongoing basis.

- Chapter 4: Identify Underserved Customer Needs (Step 2)
	- The author doesn't distinguish between needs, desires, goals, pain points, stories, and wants because he will provide a framework for prioritizing needs.
	- Customer needs are like onions with multiple layers.
	- Each need is expressed from the customer's perspective with a verb, benefit (increase or decrease), and something of value which can be measured.
	- The best way to test a hypothetical customer need is in a one-on-one in-person customer discovery interview.
	- (want to take notes on how to do a discovery interview)

- Chapter 7: Create Your MVP Prototype (Step 5)
- Chapter 8: Apply the Principles of Great UX Design
- Chapter 9: Test Your MVP with Customers (Step 6)
- Chapter 10: Iterate and Pivot to Improve Product-Market Fit
- Chapter 11: An End-to-End Lean Product Case Study

# Part III: Building and Optimizing Your Product
- Chapter 12: Build Your Product Using Agile Development
	- "Agile Development" is a broad term used to describe iterative and incremental development strategies.  It is different than Big Design Up Front (BDUF like the waterfall strategy)
	- "There are known knowns.  There are things we know we know.  We also know there are known unknowns.  That is to say, we know there are some things we do not know.  But there are also unknown unknowns.  The ones we don't know we don't know." - Donald Rumsfield
		- A spike task can help reveal the unknowns.
	- It's important to note that waterfall is better than agile for some projects.  We wouldn't want to send humans into space with a minimally viable space ship.
		- Use lower cost and lower risk stages to break a project up into smaller parts.
	- Extreme Programming and Lean Software Development are two varieties of Agile Development.
	- Scrum and Kanban are two of the most common agile methodologies.
